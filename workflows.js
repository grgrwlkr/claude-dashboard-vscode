// Workflow runs, read from the two trees Claude Code writes them to.

// A finished run leaves one snapshot: <session>/workflows/<runId>.json, written
// once when the run ends. A live run leaves nothing there — only the journal and
// the agent transcripts under <session>/subagents/workflows/<runId>/. The `wf_`
// prefix belongs to the run id itself, not to the naming of those paths, so
// joining one never prepends it: 73 of 73 snapshots on this machine have
// `runId === basename(file, '.json')`. Both trees are undocumented internals of a
// client that ships almost daily, so every field here is optional and a parse
// failure yields nothing rather than a wrong number.
//
// No dependency on vscode: the roots are parameters, so this runs under plain node.

// and a run with dozens of agents would carry all of it into a panel. Cutting at
// the same 400 keeps every preview whole up to the client's own limit; the one
// character it drops is that trailing ellipsis, so whatever renders these marks
// truncation itself rather than relying on the client having marked it.
